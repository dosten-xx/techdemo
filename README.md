# Project Scope

This project is to demonstrate various technologies for JEE applications.  The goal is to provide an exemplar app that others can use to learn from and contribute to.  The starting point is the Duke's Bookstore case study application from the Glassfish JEE tutorial.  That app will be modified to demonstrate new stuff.
